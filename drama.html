        <h2>The Dramatics Society   </h2><br>
        <p style="font-weight: 50;font-size: 1.3rem;">The Dramatics Society  aims to create awareness about theatre and its various aspects
            in young enthusiastic students of the college by bringing together people who are interested in the
            performing arts on a common.<br><br>

            Working tirelessly for the last 60 years to become one of the best college theatre groups, our productions
            are a result of intensive discussions and debates put together beautifully by our creative members. The
            society tries to address various social causes by understanding the dynamics and nuances of the world around
            us, by observing the grassroot issues closely and at other times, by imagining and creating a utopian world
            order as an alternative. All this, through the medium of theatre.<br><br>

             Dramatics Society has its main events (Nukkad, the street play event and Yavnika, the stage play event)
            during the annual cultural fest of the college, Tarang, which marks the grand beginning of the ‘Delhi
            University Theatre Circuit Season.<br><br>

            We have had the opportunity to work with many established directors
            and we hope to continue working with established names to help us direct our energies positively towards the
            field. This, we seek to achieve through fortnightly workshops arranged by the Society, which in turn, would
            lead to selection for working in college productions.<br><br>

            Dram(atic) Soc(iety) is the largest society in the college and one of the most active as well. It creates
            the space to learn, to embrace yourself, to make lasting friendships and to experience people at their
            creative best.<br><br>

            The Society actively takes part in inter-college festivals in and around Delhi. We practice forms such as
            street-theatre, spoofs and stage plays. During any given year, within college, we perform on Orientation
            Day, Independence Day, Teachers’ Day, Graduation Day, Inter-college theatre competition at Tarang etc.
